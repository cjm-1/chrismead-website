# chrismead-website
The source code for my personal website hosted at [chrismead.co.uk](https://chrismead.co.uk).

The website is intended to represent me on the web by sharing information about me, my projects, and my capabilities,
and include some practical interactive demos to demonstrate my skills and passion first-hand.

For ease of development, it uses _Flask_ for its ability to build pages from templates and its convenient development
server. For compatibility, there is a _Python_ script to export the project as an _nginx_-friendly static website.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (but can export to static html)
